#WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
#Welcome to my Mini-game made by corgosDance! Thanks for downloading from workshop or where ever you got it from. Maybe i gave it to you who knows. :)
#Here is how it Works! 1. Spawn an EGP Screen. I use hunter/plates/plate4x4 model. Spawn a toggle Button and both E2 Chips. Make sure to place this Spawner 
#in an open area. You can build a arena around it if you want. Wire "Run" from both chips to the Button(this Starts and PAUSES, so it won't reset your progress, to do this simly reupload the code)
#Now Wire from the HUD Chip: E[Wirelink] to the EGP Screen. Then wire the rest from the HUD Cip to the Spawner so it tracks the Waves,LVL,EXP... 
#If screen only shows a Bar, simply upload the code again and it should be fixed.
#HOW-TO-PLAY: Pick the Gravity Gun and a Pistol or only Grav-Gun, discard the rest. Every Zombie you kill will spawn Explosives. 
#Shoot them with your Grav-gun to kill more Zombies! Special Zombies and Boss fights appear and you get a small break inbetween couple of waves.
#The faster a wave dies the more XP you'll collect. Try to reach the high LVL's befor the Zombies overwhelm you, or you might accidentally blow yourself up :^)
#Fun-Rules: Grav-Gun and Pistol or only Grav. 3 Lives(respawns). Suitarmor and Healthrecharge thingys are allowed. But you can play however you like. (You could spawn a cage and make a party of npcs to face the zombie horde) 
#HAVE FUN!! corgosDance
